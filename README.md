### AI Workshop Topic Builder

This AI agent helps generate workshop topics for AI-related workshops. It includes various functions for creating tasks, generating topics, and following a standard operating procedure (SOP).

#### Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

1. **Initialization**:
    - Load necessary libraries and modules.
    - Initialize any required configurations.

2. **Input Collection**:
    - Gather input from the user about the type of workshop, target audience, and any specific requirements.

3. **Topic Generation**:
    - Generate a list of potential topics based on the input.

4. **Task Creation**:
    - Create detailed tasks for each topic, including descriptions and objectives.

5. **Review and Selection**:
    - Allow the user to review the generated topics and tasks.
    - Provide options for the user to select or refine the topics and tasks.

6. **Output**:
    - Generate a final document or list of workshop topics and tasks.
    - Provide an option to export the output to a file.

### Code Implementation

```python
import random

class AIWorkshopTopicBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.topics = [
            "Introduction to Machine Learning",
            "Natural Language Processing Basics",
            "Deep Learning with TensorFlow",
            "AI Ethics and Responsible AI",
            "Building AI Chatbots",
            "Computer Vision and Image Recognition",
            "Reinforcement Learning",
            "AI in Healthcare",
            "AI for Finance and Trading",
            "AI for Social Good"
        ]
        self.tasks = []

    def generate_topics(self, audience, requirements):
        print("Generating topics based on audience and requirements...")
        # Custom logic to filter and generate topics can be added here
        return random.sample(self.topics, 5)

    def create_tasks(self, selected_topics):
        print("Creating tasks for the selected topics...")
        for topic in selected_topics:
            task = {
                "topic": topic,
                "description": f"Conduct a comprehensive workshop on {topic}.",
                "objectives": [
                    f"Understand the basics of {topic}",
                    f"Implement a simple project related to {topic}",
                    f"Discuss real-world applications of {topic}"
                ]
            }
            self.tasks.append(task)
        return self.tasks

    def review_and_select(self):
        print("Reviewing generated topics and tasks...")
        for idx, task in enumerate(self.tasks):
            print(f"{idx + 1}. Topic: {task['topic']}")
            print(f"   Description: {task['description']}")
            print(f"   Objectives: {', '.join(task['objectives'])}")
            print()

    def export_output(self, filename="workshop_topics.txt"):
        print("Exporting the final list of workshop topics and tasks to a file...")
        with open(filename, "w") as file:
            for task in self.tasks:
                file.write(f"Topic: {task['topic']}\n")
                file.write(f"Description: {task['description']}\n")
                file.write(f"Objectives: {', '.join(task['objectives'])}\n\n")

def main():
    builder = AIWorkshopTopicBuilder()
    audience = input("Enter the target audience: ")
    requirements = input("Enter any specific requirements: ")

    topics = builder.generate_topics(audience, requirements)
    tasks = builder.create_tasks(topics)
    builder.review_and_select()
    builder.export_output()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How to Use the AI Workshop Topic Builder

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.

2. **Input Details**:
   - Provide the target audience and any specific requirements when prompted.

3. **Review Topics and Tasks**:
   - Review the generated topics and tasks in the console output.

4. **Export the Output**:
   - The final list of workshop topics and tasks will be exported to a text file named `workshop_topics.txt`.

5. **Refinement**:
   - Optionally, refine the topics and tasks as per your needs by editing the `topics` list or modifying the `create_tasks` method.

This AI Workshop Topic Builder is a versatile tool that can be further customized and extended to fit more specific use cases or integrate with other systems.
